# Piezoelectric behavior of PVDF polymer undergoing electrospinning (poling) and then doped with SnO2

# Experiments
The FTIR spectra of samples is used to quantify the absorptance spectra of different types of PVDF samples. The absorptance peaks of beta phase ( at 840 cm^{-1} ) and alpha phase ( at 763 cm^{-1})
are utilized to compute the  proportion of beta phase in the samples.
